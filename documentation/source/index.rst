Welcome to Palindrome's documentation
=====================================

This is the Palindrome project documentation. It contains a general overview (this page) as well as three separate
parts covering requirements, architecture and the implementation itself (separate sections).

My approach for this assignment has been to take it on as both an architect as well as a developer. This was requested
during the interview. This means that I have tried to spread my efforts equally across all parts, with the ambition to
demonstrate my abilities to:

 * *Analyze* and scope a project based on client needs,
 * *Design* a solution based on the needs within the scope and
 * *Implement* software according to that design.

Given the time constraint I have tried to work in as much as possible. Please take the ideas to heart, even where the
documentation or implementation may be lacking.

Requirements Specification
--------------------------

The requirement specification consists of traditional **System Requirement Specification**. I usually bundle this with
a Vision and Scope document, which is valuable to share with business stakeholder's to show them that we understand
and care about the same things. This has been omitted.

The System Requirement Specification should be seen as a static backlog. In real life this is a document that will
change frequently, have stories instead of functional/non-functional requirements and be groomed in an isssue
tracker of sorts.

Architecture Description
------------------------

The **Architecture Description** is the main deliverable of the architect. It is the physical manifestation of the
different views and perspectives on the solution and represents the design work put in, as well as proof that the
different needs are met. It elaborates on the selected options, as well as why other options have been discarded.

My preference for maintaining an architecture description for an application or solution is in a wiki. This format
lends itself particularly well to an evolving architecture, and makes it available to all its stakeholders, be it
developers, testers or other architects.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

The **Implementation Notes** is a developer's notebook that described the implementation of the software, including
how to build and deploy it, specific details of the implementation, and other important notes that belong with the
actual implementation.

For this project, it is the README.md file contained in the root of the repository.
